# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Model
## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of heart disease in patients using logistic regression. The model analyzes various health parameters to assess cardiovascular risk factors.

**Note:** This project is in its initial phase of development. The current implementation is a basic version that will be improved with additional features, better data processing, and enhanced model performance in future updates.

## Features

- Logistic regression-based prediction model  
- Data preprocessing pipeline  
- Basic feature importance analysis  
- Simple evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall)  

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+  
- pandas  
- numpy  
- scikit-learn  
- matplotlib (for visualization)  

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-prediction.git
cd heart-disease-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
Run the main script:
```bash
python heart_disease_predictor.py
```
## Current Limitations (Initial Phase)

- Basic feature engineering
- Limited hyperparameter tuning
- Simple evaluation metrics
- Needs more comprehensive error handling
- Requires additional validation datasets

## Future Improvements
- Implement more advanced machine learning models
- Add comprehensive data visualization
- Create a web interface for easy prediction
- Include more detailed evaluation metrics
- Add feature importance visualization
- Implement model persistence
